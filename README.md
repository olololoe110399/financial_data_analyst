## ðŸš€ Getting Started

To run the app locally:

1. Make sure Flutter is properly installed.
2. Run `flutter pub get` to install dependencies.
3. Update your Anthropic API key inside `chat_composable.dart`:

```dart
final financeService = FinanceService(
  client: AnthropicClient(apiKey: 'YOUR_API_KEY'),
);

## ðŸ§  How It Works

### Architecture Overview

- **Chat Interface**: Accepts text and file input from the user.
- **File Parser**: Extracts text from PDFs, images, or plain files.
- **AI Assistant**: Sends user queries + file content to Claude API for understanding.
- **Chart Generation Tool**: Automatically converts AI results into structured chart data.
- **Dynamic Chart Renderer**: Renders the chart using `fl_chart` based on chart type.

### Supported Chart Types

Each chart is dynamically rendered based on `chartType`. For example:

```dart
switch (chartData.chartType) {
  case "bar":
    return BarChartWidget(data: chartData);
  case "line":
    return LineChartWidget(data: chartData);
  case "pie":
    return PieChartWidget(data: chartData);
  // and more...
}
```

## ðŸ§ª Example Workflow

1. Upload a quarterly report in CSV or PDF format
2. Ask: *"How did revenue change over Q1 and Q2?"
3. The assistant responds with a natural language summary + visual chart
4. The chart is interactive with hover tooltips and labels
